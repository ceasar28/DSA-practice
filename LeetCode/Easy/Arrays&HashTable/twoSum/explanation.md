### Function: `twoSum`

This function takes in an array of numbers `nums` and a `target` number. It aims to find two numbers in the `nums` array that add up to the `target`. If such numbers are found, it returns their indices in an array.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Declaration:**

   - `let indices: number[]`: Initializes a variable to store indices if matching numbers are found.

2. **Mapping through the Array:**

   - `map` is created using `nums.map()` to iterate through each element in the array.
   - For each element `num` at a particular `index`:
     - Calculates the `diff` by subtracting `num` from the `target`.
     - Checks if the `diff` exists in the `nums` array from the position `(index + 1)` onwards using `nums.includes(diff, (index + 1))`.

3. **Finding Matching Numbers:**

   - If the `diff` exists in the array:
     - Determines the index of `diff` using `nums.indexOf(diff, (index + 1))`.
     - Sets the `indices` variable to an array containing the current index `index` and the found index `indexOf`.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns the `indices` array, which holds the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the `target`.

This function essentially scans through the input array and checks for pairs of numbers that add up to the target value. If found, it returns the indices of those numbers in the array.
